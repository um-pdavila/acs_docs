Pegasus Projects & Resources
============================

Access to IDSC Advanced Computing resources is managed on a **project**
basis. This allows us to better support interaction between teams
(including data sharing) at the University of Miami regardless of group,
school, or campus. Project-based resource allocation also gives
researchers the ability to request resources for short-term work. Any
University of Miami faculty member or Principal Investigator (PI) can
request a new project. All members of a project share that project’s
resource allocations.

To join a project, contact the project owner. PIs and faculty, request new `IDSC Projects here <https://idsc.miami.edu/project_request>`_ (https://idsc.miami.edu/project_request)

Using projects in computing jobs
--------------------------------

To run jobs using your project’s resources, submit jobs with your
assigned ``projectID`` using the ``-P`` argument to ``bsub``:
``bsub -P projectID``. For more information about LSF and job
scheduling, see :ref:`Scheduling Jobs on Pegasus <p-jobs>`.

For example, if you were assigned the project id "abc", a batch
submission from the command line would look like:

::

    $ bsub -P abc < JOB_SCRIPT_NAME

and an interactive submission from the command line would look like:

::

    $ bsub -P abc -Is -q interactive -XF command

When your job has been submitted successfully, the project and queue
information will be printed on the screen.

::

    Job is submitted to <abc> project.

    Job <11234> is submitted to default queue <general>.

The cluster scheduler will only accept job submissions to active
projects. The IDSC user must be a current member of that project.
