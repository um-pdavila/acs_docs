Matlab on Pegasus
=================

Interactive Mode
----------------

There are several ways to run MATLAB commands/jobs interactively, with
or without the graphical interface.

Graphical Interface Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run MATLAB using graphical interface mode, connect with display
forwarding. For more information about display forwarding, see
:ref:`Forwarding the Display <x11>`.

Load and launch MATLAB on one of the interactive compute nodes as shown
below. If you belong to more than one project, specify the ``projectID``
as well.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ module load matlab
    [username@pegasus ~]$ bsub -Is -q interactive -XF -P projectID matlab

Once the interactive MATLAB graphical desktop is loaded, you can then
run MATLAB commands or scripts in the MATLAB command window. The results
will be shown in the MATLAB command window and the figure/plot will be
displayed in new graphical windows on your computer. See examples below.

::

    >> x = rand(1,100);
    >> plot(x);
    >>
    >> x = [0: pi/10: pi];
    >> y = sin(x);
    >> z = cos(x);
    >> figure;
    >> plot(x, y);
    >> hold('on');
    >> plot(x, z, '--');

Graphical Interactive Mode with no graphical desktop window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running MATLAB in a full graphical mode may get slow depending on the
network load. Running it with ``-nodesktop`` option will use your
current terminal window (in Linux/Unix) as a desktop, while allowing you
still to use graphics for figures and editor.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ module load matlab
    [username@pegasus ~]$ bsub -Is -q interactive -XF -P projectID matlab -nodesktop

Non-Graphical interactive Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MATLAB commands/jobs do not need to show graphics such as
figures and plots, or to use a built-in script editor, run the MATLAB in
the non-graphical interactive mode with ``-nodisplay``.

Open a regular ssh connection to Pegasus.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ module load matlab
    [username@pegasus ~]$ bsub -Is -q interactive -P projectID matlab -nodisplay

This will bring up the MATLAB command window:

::

                                < M A T L A B (R) >

To exit, type ``exit`` or ``quit``. Again, remember to import the
prepared LSF configuration file mentioned above if you want to use
MATLAB parallel computing.

Batch Processing
----------------

For off-line non-interactive computations, submit the MATLAB script to
the LSF scheduler using the ``bsub`` command. For more information about
job scheduling, see :ref:`Scheduling Jobs <p-jobs>`. Example
single-processor job submission:

::

    [username@pegasus ~]@ bsub < example.job

``example.job``

--------------

.. code:: bash

    #BSUB -J example
    #BSUB -q general
    #BSUB -P projectID
    #BSUB -n 1
    #BSUB -o example.o%J
    #BSUB -e example.e%J
    matlab -nodisplay -r my_script

In this example, “my_script” corresponds to “my_script.m” in the current
working directory.

After the job is finished, the results will be saved in the output file
named “example.o\ *######*” where “*######*” is a ``jobID`` number
assigned by LSF when you submit your job.

Parallel Computations
---------------------

.. MATLAB has software products to enable parallel computations for
.. multi-core computers as well as for multiple-node computer clusters. The
.. latter case scenario requires a job scheduler, such as LSF on the Pegasus
.. cluster.

.. The MATLAB product for the parallel processing that uses the cores of
.. the same node is the “Distributed Computing Toolbox/DCT” (also appears
.. in MATLAB documentation under the name of “Parallel Computing Toolbox”).
.. Licensed MATLAB software product for a computer cluster is called
.. “Distributed Computing Engine/DCE” (also appears in documentation as
.. “MATLAB Distributed Computing Server”).

MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox™ and Distributed Computing Server™ let users run 
MATLAB programs and Simulink models on multi-core and/or multi-node computer clusters. 
The Parallel Computing Toolbox, a toolbox of parallel-enabled functions 
that abstracts away the complexity of parallel programming, enables
the user to write code that scales across multiple compute cores and/or processors
without needing any modification. Furthermore, the Parallel Computing 
Toolbox defines the jobs and their distribution to MATLAB computational engines or workers.
The MATLAB Distributed Computing Server is responsible for the execution of the 
jobs, and interfaces with resource schedulers such as LSF, effectively mapping each MATLAB worker 
to the available cores of multicore standalone/cluster computers.

Single-node parallel MATLAB jobs (up to 16 cpus)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MATLAB Distributed Computing Server™ can be used to
provide up to 16 MATLAB computational engines or workers on a single node
on Pegasus. You may get up to 15 workers on the **general** queue, and 
up to 16 on the **parallel** one. For more information
about queue and parallel resource distribution requirements, see
:ref:`Scheduling Jobs <p-jobs>`.


.. build-in default MATLAB cluster
.. profile **‘local’**, from which the pool of MatlabWorkers can be
.. reserved for computations. The default number of MatlabWorkers is 12.
.. You can specify up to 15 on a single Pegasus node using the **general**
.. queue, and 16 cpus using the **parallel** queue. For more information
.. about queue and parallel resource distribution requirements, see
.. :ref:`Scheduling Jobs <p-jobs>`.

Documentation from MATLAB outlines strategies and tools from the 
Parallel Computing Toolbox that help adapt your script for
multi-processor calculations. One of the tools available is a parallel
construct of the ubiquitous ``for`` loop, which is named the ``parfor`` loop,
and the syntax for its use is as shown in the script right below. Essentially,
what would have been a set of sequential operations on a single processor 
can now be a set of parallel operations over a parallel pool (parpool) 
of 16 MATLAB workers.

.. code:: matlab

    %==============================================================
    % dct_example.m
    % Distributed Computing Toolbox (DCT)
    % Example: Print datestamp within a parallel "parfor" loop
    %==============================================================
    %% Create a parallel pool of workers on the current working node:
    parpool('local',16);
    % The test loop size
    N = 40;       
    tstart = tic();
    parfor(ix=1:N)
      ixstamp = sprintf('Iteration %d at %s\n', ix, datestr(now));
      disp(ixstamp);
      pause(1);
    end
    cputime=toc(tstart);
    toctime= sprintf('Time used is %d seconds', cputime);
    disp(toctime)
    %% delete current parallel pool:
    delete(gcp)  

Multi-node parallel MATLAB jobs (16-32 cpus)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MATLAB licenses the MATLAB Distributed Computer Engine™  for 
running multi-processor jobs that involve 16+ cpus and more
than a single node. We have up to 32 licenses
available on Pegasus, and this makes it possible to run jobs
on up to 32 cores. The first thing that needs to be done is to 
make sure that Pegasus, running LSF, is discoverable to MATLAB. 
To do this, the user has the MATLAB client use the cluster 
configuration file ``/share/opt/MATLAB/etc/LSF1.settings`` to create 
a cluster profile (for themself). This is done as follows:

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ matlab -nodisplay -r "parallel.importProfile('/share/opt/MATLAB/etc/LSF1.settings')"

::

    [username@pegasus ~] >> exit

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ reset


This command only needs to be run once. It imports the cluster profile
named ‘LSF1’ that is configured to use up to 32 MatlabWorkers and to
submit MATLAB jobs to the **parallel** Pegasus queue. This profile does
not have a ``projectID`` associated with the job, and you may need to
coordinate the project name for the LSF job submission. This can be done
by running the following script ``conf_lsf1_project_id.m`` (only once!) 
during your matlab session:

.. code:: matlab

    %% conf_lsf1_project_id.m
    %% Verify that LSF1 profile exists, and indicate the current default profile:
    [allProfiles,defaultProfile] = parallel.clusterProfiles()
    %% Define the current cluster object using LSF1 profile
    myCluster=parcluster('LSF1')
    %% View current submit arguments:
    get(myCluster,'SubmitArguments')
    %% Set new submit arguments, change projectID below to your current valid project:
    set(myCluster,'SubmitArguments','-q general -P projectID')
    %% Save the cluster profile:
    saveProfile(myCluster)
    %% Set the 'LSF1' to be used as a default cluster profile instead of a 'local'
    parallel.defaultClusterProfile('LSF1');
    %% Verify the current profiles and the default:
    [allProfiles,defaultProfile] = parallel.clusterProfiles()


*The multi-node parallel jobs must be submitted to the **parallel** queue with the
appropriate ptile resource distribution.* For more information about
queue and resource distribution requirements, see :ref:`Scheduling
Jobs <p-jobs>`.




The above script also reviews your current settings of the cluster
profiles. You can now use the cluster profile for distributed
calculations on up to 32 CPUs, for example, to create a pool of
MatlabWorkers for a ``parfor`` loop:

.. code:: matlab

    %=========================================================
    % dce_example.m
    % Distributed Computing Engine (DCE) 
    % Example: Print datestamp within a parallel "parfor" loop
    %=========================================================
    myCluster=parcluster('LSF1')
    % Maximum number of MatlabWorkers is 32 (number of MATLAB DCE Licenses)
    parpool(myCluster,32);
    % The test loop size
    N = 40;  
    tstart = tic();
    parfor(ix=1:N)
      ixstamp = sprintf('Iteration %d at %s\n', ix, datestr(now));
      disp(ixstamp);
      pause(1);
    end
    cputime=toc(tstart);
    toctime= sprintf('Time used is %d seconds', cputime);
    disp(toctime)
    delete(gcp)

Please see MATLAB documentation on more ways to parallelize your code.

There may be other people running Distributed Computing Engine and thus
using several licenses. Please check the license count as following (all
in a single line):

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ /share/opt/MATLAB/R2013a/etc/lmstat -S MLM -c /share/opt/MATLAB/R2013a/licenses/network.lic

Find the information about numbers of licenses used for the “Users of
MATLAB_Distrib_Comp_Engine”, “Users of MATLAB”, and “Users of
Distrib_Computing_Toolbox”.

Note on Matlab cluster configurations
-------------------------------------

After importing the new cluster profile, it will remain in your
available cluster profiles. Validate using the
``parallel.clusterProfiles()`` function. You can create, change, and
save profiles using ``SaveProfile`` and ``SaveAsProfile`` methods on a
cluster object. In the examples, “myCluster” is the cluster object. You
can also create, import, export, delete, and modify the profiles through
the “Cluster Profile Manager” accessible via MATLAB menu in a graphical
interface. It is accessed from the “HOME” tab in the GUI desktop window
under “ENVIRONMENT” section: ->“Parallel”->“Manage Cluster Profiles”

You can also create your own LSF configuration from the Cluster Profile
Manager. Choose “Add”->“Custom”->“3RD PARTY CLUSTER PROFILE”->“LSF” as
shown below:

.. figure:: assets/MatlabParallel2.png
   :alt: Cluster Profile Manager: new LSF cluster
