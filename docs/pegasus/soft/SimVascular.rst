SimVascular on Pegasus
============

SimVascular is available as a software module on Pegasus. SimVascular graphical jobs can be submitted to 
the LSF scheduler via the interactive queue using the tk gui.


Forwarding X11
-------

In order to launch a SimVascular interactive job, you will need to login to Pegasus with X11 forwarding enabled.

You will also need to install an X11 server on your local machine such as Xming for Windows or XQuartz for Mac.

Please see the following guide on how to achieve this:

Loading the Module
-------
The SimVascular module is dependent on the gcc/8.3.1 software module. This will come pre-loaded once the SimVascular module has been loaded.

Launching Graphical Interactive Jobs

You can use the following command to launch an interactive job. Be Sure to use the -tk parameter when launching SimVascular in order to utilize
the tk gui.
