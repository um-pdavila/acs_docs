Introduction to Linux on Pegasus
--------------------------------

Pegasus is currently running the CentOS 6.5 operating system, a
distribution of Linux. Linux is a UNIX-like kernel, though in this
document it will generally refer to the entire CentOS distribution. The
three basic components of UNIX-like operating systems are the
**kernel**, **shell**, and **system programs**. The kernel handles
resource management and program execution. The shell interprets user
commands typed at a prompt. System programs implement most operating
system functionalities such as user environments and schedulers.

Everything in Linux is either a **file** (a collection of data) or a
**process** (an executing program). Directories in Linux are types of
files.

In the below examples, ``username`` represents your access account.
