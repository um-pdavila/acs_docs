Navigating the Linux Shell
==========================

The shell is command-line interface (CLI), a type of user interface that
interprets **commands** typed at a prompt. The default shell on Pegasus
is Bash.

Users send commands to the shell, which runs them and outputs results.
Commands can include options (or **flags**) to modify output and
**arguments** to specify command targets. In Bash, command history can
be accessed from the prompt with up and down arrow keys - use this to
repeat a previously issued command.

Below are some useful Linux shell commands with explanations and
examples. Recall that Linux is *case-sensitive*– "name" is distinct from
"NAME" and other capital and lower-case combinations ("Name", "nAMe",
etc.). To cancel a process and return to the prompt in Linux, press
``CTRL-C`` in Windows or ``Command-C`` in Mac.

View your current shell with ``echo``:
--------------------------------------

The ``echo`` command displays a line of text. In Linux, ``$`` denotes a
**variable**. The ``$SHELL`` environment variable contains your current
shell. To view the contents of this variable, send it to the ``echo``
command. Variables will be interpreted by the command even when inside
lines of text, as shown below.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ echo $SHELL
    /bin/bash
    [username@pegasus ~]$ echo "My shell is $SHELL"
    My shell is /bin/bash

View all environment variables with ``env``:
--------------------------------------------

To view all your environment variables, use the ``env`` command. To view
this list alphanumerically, use ``env | sort``.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ env
    MODULE_VERSION_STACK=3.2.10
    LC_PAPER=en_US.utf8
    HOSTNAME=login4
    SHELL=/bin/bash
    ...
    [username@pegasus ~]$ env | sort
    ...

View your current directory with ``pwd``:
-----------------------------------------

**Directories** in Linux are similar to folders in other operating
systems. Your home directory is the default location after login. The
shortcut for home in Bash is the tilde (``~``), shown below just before
the prompt (``$``). ``pwd`` outputs the **absolute path**, the unique
location starting from the topmost, or root, directory (``/``).

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ pwd
    /nethome/username

View the contents of a directory with ``ls``:
---------------------------------------------

Entering the ``ls`` command without arguments (as shown below) lists the
contents of the current directory. *If this is your first connection to
Pegasus, your home directory may be empty.* Directories can be
distinguished from files by the leading ``d`` in file permissions.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ ls 
    example_file1  example_file2  testdir1

To view the contents of a specific directory, send the path as an
argument to ``ls``. In this example the current directory is home, which
contains ``testdir1``. As shown in the output, ``testdir1`` contains one
file: ``testdir1_file1``

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ ls testdir1
    testdir1_file1

Note that you can press the ``TAB`` key on your keyboard to
auto-complete names. If there are multiple matches, a list of options
will be shown. Type the next letter and press TAB again until
tab-complete finishes.

Command details and flag information can be found in the **Linux manual
pages**, accessible via the command line:

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ man topic or command

Press ``SPACE`` to see the next set of lines. To scroll, use the arrow
keys or ``Page Up`` and ``Page Down``. To exit, type ``q``.

``ls`` can be run with options, or flags, to customise output. For
example, view more detailed information such as file permissions using
the ``-lh`` flags.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ ls -lh
    total 0
    -rw-r--r-- 1 username ccsuser  54  example_file1
    -rw-r--r-- 1 username ccsuser 476  example_file2
    drwxr-xr-x 2 username ccsuser 512  testdir1
    ...

The flags on this ``ls -lh`` command:

-  ``-l`` long list format (includes permissions, owner, and more)
-  ``-h`` human readable filesize format (useful for larger file sizes)

Other useful ``ls`` flags:

-  ``-a`` include hidden files \*
-  ``-d`` list properties of a directory itself, not the contents
-  ``-1`` (**number 1**) one result per line
-  ``-R`` recursively list subdirectory contents
-  ``-S`` sort by file size
-  ``-X`` sort alphanumerically by extension
-  ``-m`` comma-separated list

\* Hidden files include the **.** and **..** directories, which
represent the current and parent (respectively). These can be used as
shortcuts in relative paths:

::

    [username@pegasus testdir1]$ ls -a
    .  ..  testdir1_file1
    [username@pegasus testdir1]$ ls ..
    example_file1  example_file2  testdir1

Navigate to directories with ``cd``:
------------------------------------

This command changes your current directory to the path specified, which
can be **absolute**, starting with ``/``, or **relative**, starting from
the current directory.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ cd testdir1
    [username@pegasus testdir1]$

Some useful ``cd`` commands:

-  ``cd`` or ``cd ~`` move to user’s home directory
-  ``cd ..`` move to parent directory
-  ``cd -`` move to previous working directory

View directory contents with ``tree``:
--------------------------------------

Pegasus has the ``tree`` package installed, which recursively outputs a
depth-indented list of contents. This may be more helpful than ``ls``
for nested directories.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ tree -vC
    .
    |-- example_file1
    |-- example_file2
    |-- testdir1
        `-- testdir1_file1

    1 directory, 3 files

The flags on this ``tree -vC`` command:

-  ``-v`` sort alphanumerically by type
-  ``-C`` colorise output

Other useful ``tree`` flags:

-  ``-a`` include hidden files
-  ``-d`` list directories only
-  ``-r`` sort reverse alphanumerically
-  ``-L number`` descend only *number* levels deep

Check command availability and location with ``which``:
-------------------------------------------------------

The ``which`` command returns the full path of any shell commands
registered in the current environment by searching locations in the
``$PATH`` environment variable. Use ``which`` to check command and
software availability and location.

::

    [username@pegasus ~]$ which bash
    /bin/bash
    [username@pegasus ~]$ which vim
    /usr/bin/vim
    [username@pegasus ~]$ which python
    /share/opt/python/2.7.3/bin/python
