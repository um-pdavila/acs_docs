Triton Job Queues
==================

Triton queues are organized using limits like job size, job length, job
purpose, and project. In general, users run jobs on Pegasus with equal
resource shares. Current or recent resource usage lowers the priority
applied when LSF assigns resources for new jobs from a user’s account.

The **bigmem** queue is available for jobs requiring nodes with expanded
memory. Submitting jobs to this queue requires project membership. Do
not submit jobs that can run on the general and parallel queues to the
bigmem queue.
