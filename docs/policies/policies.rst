IDSC ACS Policies
================

IDSC Advanced Computing Services resources are available to all University of Miami employees and students. Use of IDSC resources is governed by `University of Miami Acceptable Use Policies <http://it.miami.edu/about-umit/policies-and-procedures/>`_ in addition to IDSC ACS policies, terms, and conditions.


Accounts
--------

- To qualify for an IDSC account, you must be affiliated with the University of Miami.
- All IDSC accounts must be linked with a valid corresponding University of Miami account.
- Suspended accounts cannot submit jobs to IDSC clusters. 
- Suspended accounts will be disabled after 90 days.
- Disabled accounts cannot log into the Pegasus cluster.
- Disabled account data will be deleted after 30 days.

IDSC Links
----------------

- `IDSC Project Request Form <https://idsc.miami.edu/project_request>`_
- `IDSC Software Requests : e-mail IDSC <mailto:hpc@ccs.miami.edu>`_

Supercomputers
---------------------

- All users of IDSC supercomputers are required to have an IDSC account.
- All SSH sessions are closed automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- No backups are performed on cluster file systems.
- IDSC does not alter user files.
- Jobs running on clusters may be terminated for:
  
  - using excessive resources or exceeding 30 minutes of CPU time on login nodes
  - failing to reserve appropriate LSF resources
  - backgrounding LSF processes with the & operator
  - running on inappropriate LSF queues
  - running from data on ``/nethome``
    
  The IDSC account responsible for those jobs may be suspended.

- Users with disabled IDSC accounts must submit a request to `hpc@ccs.miami.edu <mailto:hpc@ccs.miami.edu>`_ for temporary account reactivation.


Allocations
-----------

- Active cluster users are allocated a logical **home** directory area on the cluster, ``/nethome/username``, limited to 250GB. 
- Active projects can be allocated scratch directories:  ``/scratch/projects/projectID``, intended for compiles and run-time input & output files. 
- Disk allocations are only for data currently being processed.
- Data for running jobs must be staged exclusively in the ``/scratch`` file system. IDSC accounts staging job data in the ``/nethome`` filesystem may be suspended.
- Both **home** and **scratch** are available on all nodes in their respective clusters.
- Accounts exceeding the 250GB home limit will be suspended. Once usage is under 250GB, the account will be enabled.

Software
----------

- Users are free to install software in their home directories on IDSC clusters. More information about installing software onto ACS systems on `ReadTheDocs <https://acs-docs.readthedocs.io/>`_ : `https://acs-docs.readthedocs.io/ <https://acs-docs.readthedocs.io/>`_
- Cluster software requests are reviewed quarterly. Global software packages are considered only when a minimum of 20 users require them.
